The attack works by taking repeated alterations in the shape of a square on the image, keeping it if it increases the loss of the model.

        "2. `w`: the side length of the original image. For CIFAR-10 $w = 32$ because images are $3 \\times 32 \\times 32$.\n",

        "Before we implement our attack we have to determine a schedule for the sizes of the squares we will be adding to our image. We would like to start with large squares to make high level changes to the image before moving to smaller squares to make more fine-grained adjustments.\n",
        "\n",
        "The schedule proposed in the paper takes a square that has a size such that it modifies roughly $p$ percentage of pixels in the image. Then after some amount of iterations, the value of $p$ is halved so that the next round of squares will be smaller. More concretely, if $w$ is the side length of the original image, the side length of the square to modify is the closest positive integer to $\\sqrt{p * w^2}$.\n",

        "Below you will see a constant array `HALF_POINT_VALUES`. At these values $p$ is halved. We hardcode the same values for `HALF_POINT_VALUES` used in the original paper. In your function, you will use this variable to determine the side length of the modifying square at iteration $i$ given $w$ and an initial $p$.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Sidenote:** Our solution uses a loop to find `square_schedule` which is not the most efficient solution but we believe it is the easiest to understand. In the [code released for the paper](https://github.com/max-andr/square-attack/blob/master/attack.py), the authors use a large if/elif/else statement which is called at each iteration but this is also suboptimal. The most efficient solution would not require so many repeated calls to the scheduler function but this would make the code harder to understand so we leave this as an exercise to the reader.\n",
