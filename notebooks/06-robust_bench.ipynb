        "The problem with our defense is it manipulated gradients such that we \"fool\" PGD or CW specifically. However, we haven't done anything to account for the underlying problem: that our model has learned a brittle representations for each of the CIFAR classes that can be disrupted with pixel-level perturbations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, against AutoAttack, our defense does extremely well against white box methods that rely directly on the gradients of input. However, when tested against square, which does not rely directly on the gradients of the input, the true robustness of our model is exposed. In truth, our defense above does little or nothing to protect our model against any competent attacker. It also doesn't demonstrate anything interesting and doesn't push the state of the art forward.\n",
